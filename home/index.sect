  Welcome to the Fall 2013 session of Grinnell College's CSC 295, a
  special topics course entitled <emphasis>Thinking Beyond Grinnell -
  Learning from Alumni</emphasis>.  In this course, we will meet (often
  virtually) with alumni with careers related to computer science who
  will talk about their life and career paths, and will provide advice
  for students on things to learn and things to do.  You can read the
  <ulink url="../handouts/blurb.html">offical blurb</ulink> for more details.
</para>

<para>
  The focus of the class is the visits by alumni.  While some of these
  visits will involve alumni coming directly to campus, the majority of
  the visits will be <quote>virtual</quote>, via Skype or some other
  teleconferencing system.
</para>

<para>
  The Web site for the course is
  <code><ulink url="&url;"/></code>
  You can find all sorts of interesting things on the course web, and I'd
  encourage you to look there.
</para>

<para>
  This is an <emphasis>experimental</emphasis> course.  Among other
  things, this means that I expect to be updating the syllabus as the
  semester goes on.

<section id="facilitating"><title>Facilitating Visits</title>

<para>
  The students in this course are responsible for hosting and facilitating
  the visits of the alumni.  (Practice with organizing visits is one
  of the learning goals of the course.)  At the start of the semester,
  students will sign up in groups to facilitate alumni visits (see <ulink
  url="../handouts/schedule.html">the schedule</ulink> for details of
  particular visits).
</para>

<para>
  As the facilitator for a visit, you are expected to work with the alumnus
  or alumna on the following in advance of the visit.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    Develop a structure for their visit.  While most visits will involve
    a moderate-length lecture (say 45 minutes) and a follow-up question
    and answer (or discussion) session, some alumni might want to consider
    other approaches.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    Identify any resources that they would like students to read or
    explore before their talk.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    Write a short biographical sketch that can be distributed to the
    class before the class meeting.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    Write a short abstract for the lecture that can be distributed to
    the class before the class meeting.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    Work out any technological issues for their visit.  For in-class
    visits, that means making sure that we have the resources (Internet,
    projection, etc.) that they need for the visit.  For remote visits,
    that means making sure that Skype (or whatever communication system
    they suggest) works appropriately.
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  Your work also continues into the class session.  During the class session
  you facilitate, you should do the following:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    Arrive early to set up technologies.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    Introduce the alumna or alumnus.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    Continue to monitor technologies during class.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    Facilitate discussion.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    Be ready to ask a wide variety of questions.
