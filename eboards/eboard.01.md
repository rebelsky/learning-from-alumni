Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Remember CS Extra Thursday and CS Table Friday.

### Questions

About the course
----------------

* Intended as a resource for Grinnell students.
    * Learn about different careers.  (In CS)
    * Learn about what employers look for.
        * Because CS is different.
        * And as much as we love liberal arts, we want jobs.
    * Learn about the job search process.
        * There are lots of processes.
        * [Stories about Megan and Soren that Sam will not commit to
          electrons.]
    * And more.
* Sam thinks it's important, but wants to see more student involvement.
    * How important?  I taught it last year with no compensation.
    * What involvement?  Interact with the alums.  Perhaps even interact
      with other alums.
* You have a lot of responsibility for the course.  (Not because I want
  to offload work, but because I think you gain from interacting directly
  with the alums.)
* Your jobs
    * Show up.
    * Ask good questions.  Let me say that again: Ask good questions.
    * Co-host about three alums this semester.
    * Send reflective paragraphs.
    * If hosting an on-campus alum, maybe get dinner partners.
    * Do an informational interview with at least one alum.  (It need not
      be one of those who visit.)

* Hacking in your spare time for fun and profit [7]

* How to work in technology without moving to San Francisco and still enjoy it [3]
* Oh, the people you'll meet (or, how to interact effectively with your coworkers) [3]

A strategy for hosting alums
----------------------------

* We're going to work together to set up a description of the course
  that you can provide to alums, a template for questions to ask,
  and so on and so forth.
* About 45 minutes of life story
* About 30 minutes of "something useful for students to know"
* Time for Q&A

Other course details
--------------------

* Just in case there are any other.

Important lessons from previous semesters
-----------------------------------------

* Have side projects
* Network
* Do informational interviews with alums
* Have an elevator pitch

Resume review
-------------

* I asked for resumes primarily so that you've had them for future
  visits.
* We'll spend a few minutes looking at your resumes.
* Important characteristics of resumes?
    * Individual: Whose resume is this?
    * Appearance/formatting
        * Spelling.  
    * Length: Typically one page.
    * Content.  We want to know what you've done (and that it's good stuff)
    * Clarity of presentation.
* What did you learn in looking at resumes?
    * Some benefit to putting things in order of importance.  Most
      people read from top to bottom, so don't lose them early on.
        * Contact Information
        * Profile (?) / Objectives (?)
        * Education
        * CS-Related Experiences (or position-related work)
        * Other Work
    * You may not need to include the profile and objectives, but writing
      them can help you think about how you present yourself elsewhere.
    * Formatting can help draw the eye to important things
        * Bad formatting can be a serious negative because CS folks
          should be able to use software
    * Find ways to highlight other skills you have, even if they don't
      show through job experience?
* Differences between resumes?
    * Extracurricular activities
        * Some aspects are implicit
        * Some might be explicit
    * GPA
    * Relevant coursework
    * High school stuff?
    * Programming Languages
        * Having done stuff in "hacky" languages is good
        * Calling HTML is a programming language is bad
* What are questions we might have for alums about resumes?
    * "I was told you should quantify".  Should I?  What should be
      quantified?  Lines of code?
    * How should I present my extracurriculars?
    * How should I present my programming language knowledge?
    * Should I include Office / Word?
