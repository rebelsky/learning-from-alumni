About the course (revisited)
----------------------------

* Intended as a resource for Grinnell students.
* Sam thinks it's important, but wants to see more student involvement.
* You have a lot of responsibility for the course.  (Not because I want
  to offload work, but because I think you gain from interacting directly
  with the alums.)
* Your jobs
    * Show up
    * Ask good questions
    * Co-host three alums this semester
    * Send reflective paragraphs
    * If hosting an on-campus alum, maybe get dinner partners

Choosing hosts
--------------

* We'll spend a few minutes with each person indicating who they 
  would like to host.

A strategy for hosting alums
----------------------------

* We're going to work together to set up a description of the course
  that you can provide to alums, a template for questions to ask,
  and so on and so forth.

Other course details
--------------------

* Just in case they are any other.

Resume review
-------------

* I asked for resumes primarily so that you've had them for future
  visits.
* We'll spend a few minutes looking at your resumes.
