About the course
----------------

* Intended as a resource for Grinnell students.
    * Learn about different careers.
    * Learn about what employers look for.
    * Learn about the job search process.
    * And more.
* Sam thinks it's important, but wants to see more student involvement.
    * How important?  I taught it last year with no compensation.
    * What involvement?  Interact with the alums.  Perhaps even interact
      with other alums.
* You have a lot of responsibility for the course.  (Not because I want
  to offload work, but because I think you gain from interacting directly
  with the alums.)
* Your jobs
    * Show up.
    * Ask good questions.  Let me say that again: Ask good questions.
    * Co-host about three alums this semester.
    * Send reflective paragraphs.
    * If hosting an on-campus alum, maybe get dinner partners.
    * Do an informational interview with at least one alum.  (It need not
      be one of those who visit.)

  would like to host.

* Shaping the direction of your career
* How to work in technology without moving to San Francisco and still enjoy it
* Oh, the people you'll meet (or, how to interact effectively with your coworkers)

A strategy for hosting alums
----------------------------

* We're going to work together to set up a description of the course
  that you can provide to alums, a template for questions to ask,
  and so on and so forth.

Other course details
