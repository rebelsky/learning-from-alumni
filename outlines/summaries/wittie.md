Lea Wittie graduated Grinnell College in 1998 with a B.A. in Computer
Science. She went straight into a Ph.D. program in Computer Science at
Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth, she worked on programming language
projects and eventually wrote a thesis on type-safe concurrency. Lea
defended her Ph.D. thesis in 2004 and a few months later became an
Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department of Bucknell
University. As a professor, she teaches undergraduate classes, researches
programming languages with students, and works on University service
projects such as ABET accreditation for the Computer Science department
and Middle States accreditation for the University. She also designs
new courses such as a crash course in robotics and automated vehicles
for first year students in Engineering and an upper level elective
in compiler design and optimization for Computer Science majors. She
received tenure in 2011 and became an Associate Professor. Lea loves
her job and plans to stay in it for at least the next 30 years.
