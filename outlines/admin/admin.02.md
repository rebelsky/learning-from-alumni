* I don't seem to have received paragraphs on Dr. Wittie from all of you.  
  Please send them ASAP.
* Please encourage your friends to come to these talks, even if they 
  don't register.
* For folks who visit in person, I may try to set up dinners.  Hosts
  will be expected to try to get a list of interested students.
* Sorry for disorganization.  A large and unexpected administrative task
  hit two weeks before classes started, took me about 40 hours, and I'm
  still not caught up.
* I'm working to get my notes on Lea Wittie's visit into an EBoard.
  (I need to check them over and have her approve them.)
* Tomorrow's CS Table: Turing on AI
* Next Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.: Art and Technology talk in JRC 101.
* Next Thursday's CS Extra (tentative): Matt Atherton '95.
